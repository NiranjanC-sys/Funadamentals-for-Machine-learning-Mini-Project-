 Wine Quality Classification

This repository presents a machine learning project focused on classifying wine quality. We utilize a dataset containing various physicochemical properties of red and white wines And compared with two models accuracy.

Key Steps:

* Data Exploration
* Feature Engineering
* Model Selection and Training
* Model Evaluation
* Result Analysis

Model Comparison:

Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable model, often used as a baseline.
Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A powerful model capable of handling complex decision boundaries.
